=====================

The repository for the Frontend JavaScript course in [Hack Bulgaria](https://hackbulgaria.com)

## How to use this repository

The first separation if based on weeks - starting from week 0.

In each week, there are tasks, separated in folder, starting with numbers like: `1-Do-this-first`

In each task folder, the instructions are given in the `README.md` file. If there are anything required, it is located in that folder.

Each week has a `materials.md` file, where we put the things that need to be checked first, before going into task-solving.

Usually, you will find code samples, links and videos about the topic of the week.
